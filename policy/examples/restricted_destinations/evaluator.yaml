  description: >
    Prevent access from an origin to a given destination.

    The request origin is determined by the authentication 'nationality' claim which
    indicates the two letter country code for the user's country of origin. If absent,
    the country code at the geo location of origin.ip address is used instead.

    The request destination is determined by the geo location of the destination.ip,
    or the resource.label named 'location'.
  terms:
    matches_origin_ip: locationCode(origin.ip) == spec.origin
    has_nationality: has(request.auth.claims.nationality)
    matches_nationality: has_nationality && request.auth.claims.nationality == spec.origin
    matches_dest_ip: locationCode(destination.ip) in spec.restricted_destinations
    matches_dest_label: resource.labels.location in spec.restricted_destinations
    matches_dest: matches_dest_ip || matches_dest_label
  rules:
    - match: matches_nationality && matches_dest
      output: "{'deny': true}"
    - match: "!has_nationality && matches_origin_ip && matches_dest"
      output: "{'deny': true}"
